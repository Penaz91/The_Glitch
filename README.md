# The Glitch
A little platform game where you have to use some (volountarily inserted) glitches to get to the next level, but be careful! Sometimes glitches are against you too

###Glitches completely implemented so far:
- Sticky Ceiling glitch: if you jump and hit the ceiling, you'll stick there till you press "down arrow"
- Wall Climb Glitch: if you collide with a wall and keep colliding, you'll find yourself climbing the wall
- Multiple jump Glitch: you can jump countless times in the air.
- High Jump Glitch: Each jump is twice as high

###Glitches partially implemented so far:
- Invincibility Glitch: you don't die to obstacles.
- Dead bodies Glitch: when you die your dead body won't despawn and you can use it as a platform.

###Glitches planned (not necessarily will be included):
- Ledge Glitch: if you go over a ledge, you don't fall. In order to fall you need to jump.
- Gravity glitch: instead of jumping you reverse gravity.
- Invert-o-glitch (couldn't find a better name yet): Ground kills you, obstacles don't.
- Clipping glitch: You can glitch through certain walls
- Clip-on-command glitch: Pressing down arrow makes you go through the platform you're standing on
- Hovering glitch: If you keep the jump button pressed you'll keep going up, like you were flying.
